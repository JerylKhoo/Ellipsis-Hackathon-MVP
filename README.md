### TheFourGuys

Thank you for checking out our project and we hope that it has displayed the team spirit of this team!

This [README](README.md) file contains the information you need to get started with the project.

## Project Introduction
We would like to formerly introduce our project called TheFourGuys and we decided to tackle the issue of crowd control and public security. Crowd control and public security are essential for ensuring safety, maintaining order, and preventing crime in various settings. Effective management helps avoid accidents, emergencies, and violence while creating a positive experience for people. By coordinating responses to crises, deterring criminal activities, and fulfilling legal and ethical responsibilities, these measures protect individuals and enhance overall public well-being.

To tackle the issues stated above, our solution includes a web application with a live map with crowd traffic, live dashboard with crowd traffic statistics and best route calculation with crowd traffic. We are able to calculate live traffic using routers to generate a rough model of people walking around. The routers combined with MegaMIMO can provide unlimited wireless scaling catering to the needs of the attendees and fixing the spectrum crunch issue. Our live dashboard converts critical information from the routers into comprehensive data for the stakeholders. A live heat map will provide the user with an easier understanding of the current situation. Using Google Maps API in conjunction with the data obtained, we can do a real-time generation of the best path.

## Limitations
Explain why we never use mysql - lookers studio is running online and we are using localhost.
because we are doing software based, so we are not able to attain routers to be able to set up the routing portion of the project.
