# Ellipsis-Hackathon-MVP

This is a Minimum ViablePproduct for the Ellipsis Hackathon 2024. It is a website written in HTML, using proprietaries from OneMap and Looker Studio. 

### TheFourGuys

Thank you for checking out our project and we hope that it has displayed the team spirit of this team!

This [README](README.md) file contains the information you need to get started with the project.

## Project Introduction
We would like to formerly introduce our project called TheFourGuys and we decided to tackle the issue of crowd control and public security. Crowd control and public security are essential for ensuring safety, maintaining order, and preventing crime in various settings. Effective management helps avoid accidents, emergencies, and violence while creating a positive experience for people. By coordinating responses to crises, deterring criminal activities, and fulfilling legal and ethical responsibilities, these measures protect individuals and enhance overall public well-being.

To tackle the issues stated above, our solution includes a web application with a live map with crowd traffic, live dashboard with crowd traffic statistics and best route calculation with crowd traffic. We are able to calculate live traffic using routers to generate a rough model of people walking around. The routers combined with MegaMIMO can provide unlimited wireless scaling catering to the needs of the attendees and fixing the spectrum crunch issue. Our live dashboard converts critical information from the routers into comprehensive data for the stakeholders. A live heat map will provide the user with an easier understanding of the current situation. Using OneMap API in conjunction with the data obtained, we can do a real-time generation of the best path.

## Limitations
### 1. Hosting the website locally
Since this is just our prototype, we are unable to host the webpage on a server, which brought about some functions that we are unable to utilize. Firstly we are unable to call some of the API that we intended to use. Therefore, our route planner was unable to work properly. Furthermore, we were also unable to make use of an SQL server as looker studio was an online service that was uncompatiable with our local host. However we had a workaround for this case which is by using Google Sheets for the scenario.
###2. Hardware
We were unable to get the resources for the hardware portion of the project such as the routers for the routing part of the project, therefore, we only managed to come up with our software, the webpage.
